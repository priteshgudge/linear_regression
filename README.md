# linear_regression

The first code recommended is the gradient descent which shows what the process
for linear regression actually is, explaining the learning rate and iteration parameters which often come up in machine learning algorithms.

The second file recommended is to look at the Jupyter notebook which shows an exampleof using SciKitLearn's builtin linear regression algorithm.
